nextlinux, \- manual page for nextlinux, version 1.1.7
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B nextlinux
[\fIOPTIONS\fR] \fICOMMAND \fR[\fIARGS\fR]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.IP
Nextlinux is a tool for analyzing, querying, and curating container images
to deliver the transparency, predictability, and control necessary to use
containers in production. Nextlinux is composed of a toolset that runs
locally on a host as well as a web service that monitors the container
ecosystem and provides inputs to the local toolset.
.IP
The tool has capabilities to populate a registry, run analysis,
explore/query the analysis results (including custom queries and checks),
and run policy\-based gate\-functions against container images to help an
ops team decide if a container should go into the CI/CD pipeline and on to
production based on attributes of the Dockerfile, built image, or both.
.IP
After installation, the first command run should be: 'nextlinux feeds list'
to initialize the system and load feed data.
.IP
Feeds are different types of data that the nextlinux web service makes
available for certain container image queries and scans.  At any point in
time, you can use the 'nextlinux feeds' commands to sync the latest data
from the nextlinux web service, subscribe and/or unsubscribe from nextlinux
feeds, or get a list of available feeds. Except during feeds operations,
no network connectivity is required by nextlinux to run analysis and query
images.
.IP
Configuration Files:
.IP
Nextlinux configuration files are automatically installed if not found when
looking in\-order at:  $HOME/.nextlinux/conf \fI/etc/nextlinux\fP
.IP
A default install will copy the files to $HOME/.nextlinux/conf/, but they
may be manually put in \fI/etc/nextlinux\fP for a system global config.
.IP
* config.yaml \- main configuration file. Used to override default values.
Nextlinux will search for it in $HOME/.nextlinux/conf, then in \fI/etc/nextlinux\fP.
If not found in either place, a new one is initilized and copied to
$HOME/.nextlinux
.IP
* nextlinux_gate.policy \- The global gate policy file (see nextlinux\-gate(1)
for more help on gates).
